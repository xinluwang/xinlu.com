- Stop **multitasking** (it can be done).
- Stop **procrastinating**, **saving work for tomorrow**, and **waiting to be inspired to work**.
- At the same time, stop working at an unsustainable pace. It makes leading more difficult, and to do things better, you have to stop doing so much.
- If that’s not possible, at least stop complaining about **how busy you are**. Everyone will thank you.
- Stop **feeling like you have to be authentic all the time**. It could be holding you back.
- Stop holding yourself back in these five other ways, too.
- Stop being so positive — research shows it’s not all that helpful for achieving your goals.
- And when it comes to evaluating others, stop mistaking confidence for competence.
- Speaking of things that don’t work: Stop ideating and brainstorming.
- Stop trying to delight your customers all the time.
- Stop searching for a silver bullet to your strategy dilemmas.
- That said, stop using so many battle metaphors when you talk about strategy.
- And please, stop using terrible PowerPoints and these equally terrible words in your business communications.
- Stop sitting so much. Seriously.
- Stop getting defensive. (Not that we’re accusing you.)
- And if you can’t stop doing any of these things… stop believing that you have to be perfect.
