<h2>Problem Statements</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Given a set of data points, group them into a clusters so that:<br />
    1. points within each cluster are similar to each other<br />
    2. points from different clusters are dissimilar<br />
Usually, points are in a high-dimensional space, and similarity is defined using a distance measure, such as Euclidean, Cosine, Jaccard, edit distance, …</p>

<div id="examples" class="section level2">
<h2>Examples</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Cluster customers based on their purchase histories</li>
<li>Cluster products based on the sets of customers who purchased them</li>
<li>Cluster documents based on similar words or shingles</li>
<li>Cluster DNA sequences based on edit distance</li>
</ol>

<div id="methods" class="section level2">
<h2>Methods</h2>
<ul>
<li>Hierarchical (AgglomeraHve):
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Initially, each point in cluster by itself.</li>
<li>Repeatedly combine the two “nearest” clusters into one.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Point Assignment:
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Maintain a set of clusters.</li>
<li>Place points into their “nearest” cluster.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
