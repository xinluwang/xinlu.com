<ul>
<li>Most people are very focused on superficial problems and jump from one to another, as you yourself mostly do.</li>
<li>Your problems are much smaller than you make them out to be.</li>
<li>Meditation makes this abundantly clear, and everything else much easier.</li>
<li>There&rsquo;s a profound connection between your body&rsquo;s well-being and your mental and emotional well-being.  As you age you can&rsquo;t fuck off with terrible exercise and eating habits like you did when you were young.  It&rsquo;s incredibly important and actually pretty simple to eat well (vegetables and fruit) and get exercise.</li>
<li>Western culture has multi-billionaire industries built upon causing problems with your health and selling you dubious pills to fix them.</li>
<li>Capitalism is not life, but it&rsquo;s important.  It&rsquo;s an app running in the greater OS of existence which has been shown to crash a lot and generally corrupt things.  But it&rsquo;s the framework for much, so learn it.  Study business, negotiation, finance, and the many schemes cooked up by wall street.</li>
<li>For some people capitalism is life.  Those people are psychopaths.  You will meet them. They are a unique part of humanity, one without guilt or remorse or empathy.  They are not necessarily serial killers or even criminals, but often successful business people. They have a leg up in the game of capital.  Watch your back.</li>
<li>In this crazy day of information technology and billion dollar startups, everyone has an idea on how to make something new. Look out for the people who are calm and patient; they&rsquo;re the ones that actually will make things.</li>
